Gef (/ˈdʒɛf/ JEF), also referred to as the Talking Mongoose or the Dalby Spook, 
was the name given to an allegedly talking mongoose which was claimed to inhabit a farmhouse owned by the Irving family. 
The Irvings' farm was located at Cashen's Gap near the hamlet of Dalby on the Isle of Man. 
The story was given extensive coverage by the tabloid press in Britain in the early 1930s. 
The Irvings' claims gained the attention of parapsychologists and ghost hunters, such as Harry Price, Hereward Carrington, and Nandor Fodor. 
Some investigators of the era as well as contemporary critics have concluded that Voirrey Irving used ventriloquism and family collusion to perpetuate the hoax.
